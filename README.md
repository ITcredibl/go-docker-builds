# Optimized Go Docker Builds 🏗️

A production-ready template for building minimal, secure, and fast Docker images for Go applications. This repository demonstrates industry best practices and advanced patterns for containerizing Go services.

## 📊 Results & Benchmarks

All images successfully built and run the same Go application, with dramatic size reductions:

| Dockerfile              | Size   | Description                            | Status |
|------------             |------  |-------------                           |--------|
| `dockerfile.naive`      | 1.4GB  | ❌ Anti-pattern example                | ✅ Working |
| `dockerfile.minimal`    | 25.4MB | ✅ Basic multi-stage build             | ✅ Working |
| `dockerfile.optimized`  | 24.4MB | ✅ Production-ready with security      | ✅ Working |
| `dockerfile.scratch`    | 7.91MB | ✅ Absolute minimal image              | ✅ Working |
| `dockerfile.distroless` | 52MB   | ✅ Google's distroless base            | ✅ Working |

**Total size reduction: 99.4%** (from 1.4GB to 7.91MB)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ITcredibl/optimized-go-docker-builds.git
cd optimized-go-docker-builds

# Build all image variants to see the difference
make build-all

# See the size comparison
make sizes

# Run the optimized production image
docker run -p 8080:8080 optimized-go-app:optimized

# Test the application
curl http://localhost:8080


🛠️ Advanced Production Patterns

The advanced/ directory contains solutions for complex production scenarios:

1. Multi-Platform Builds (advanced/multi-platform/)
Build for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures (Intel + Apple Silicon/AWS Graviton):

bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t your-app:multi-arch \
  -f advanced/multi-platform/Dockerfile . \
  --push

2. CGO-Enabled Applications (advanced/cgo-sqlite/)
For apps using C-linked libraries like SQLite:

bash
cd advanced/cgo-sqlite
docker build -t your-cgo-app .

3. Minimal Images with HTTPS (advanced/scratch-with-certs/)
Scratch image with CA certificates for HTTPS support:

bash
docker build -t your-https-app -f advanced/scratch-with-certs/Dockerfile .

Created as a companion to the article "From main.go to Production: Building Modern, Secure, & Lean Go Docker Images": https://medium.com/@oluseyikofo/from-main-go-to-production-building-modern-secure-lean-go-docker-images-3ec036a41894.


🎯 Conclusion: From Problem to Production
This repository provides a complete, practical blueprint for solving a common but critical problem in modern software delivery: container bloat.

The Journey:
❌ The Problem: Demonstrated how a naive approach creates massive 1.4GB images containing unnecessary tools, source code, and security vulnerabilities.

✅ The Solution: Systematically applied industry best practices—multi-stage builds, security hardening, and modern tooling—to achieve over 99% size reduction while enhancing security and performance.

🏭 Production Ready: Extended beyond basics to address real-world complexities like C dependencies, multi-architecture deployments, and automated supply chain security.

The Outcome:
You now have more than just examples; you have a production-grade template used to build:

Ultra-minimal images (7.91MB) for security-sensitive workloads

Multi-architecture builds for heterogeneous cloud environments

C-compatible images for applications with native dependencies

Fully automated pipelines that enforce security and best practices

This repository encapsulates the evolution from simple containerization to sophisticated cloud-native application delivery, providing a proven foundation for building and deploying Go services at scale.

🚀 Advanced Production Patterns
The /advanced/ directory delivers specialized solutions for complex production scenarios:

CGO Dependencies: Complete working example for applications requiring C-linked libraries (SQLite, database drivers, image processing)

Multi-Platform Builds: Single Dockerfile configuration for simultaneous amd64 and arm64 builds (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton, Raspberry Pi)

HTTPS with Scratch: Minimal scratch-based image with CA certificates for applications requiring outgoing SSL/TLS connections

These aren't theoretical examples—they're battle-tested patterns for enterprise-scale deployment challenges.

🔄 Enterprise-Grade CI/CD
This repository includes complete, working CI/CD implementations that transcend basic automation:

Security-First Pipeline: Automated vulnerability scanning, SBOM generation, and compliance-ready artifact provenance

Multi-Stage Deployment: Development → Staging → Production promotion with environment-specific configurations

Release Engineering: Automated semantic versioning, multi-architecture image builds, and container registry management

The .github/workflows/ directory provides production-tested workflows that implement modern DevSecOps practices, ready to be customized for your organization's deployment environment.

Key Improvements:
More professional tone using terms like "blueprint," "enterprise-grade," and "battle-tested"

Emphasizes the practical value beyond education ("more than just examples")

Highlights the real-world applicability for different use cases

Stronger call-out for the advanced patterns and their specific benefits
